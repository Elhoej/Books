# Books

I wrote this app as part of a challenge. I had 24 hours to complete it, and it had to support local persistence and synchronization with Google Books API.
I'm not very proud of the book detail view's design, but I spent a lot of time implementing the menu bar just below the navigation bar and its functionality, so I didn't have time when it came to the detail view.
